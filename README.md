This repository is a part of the final EECS 700: IoT Security project. This
repository holds code for the frontend and webpage interface that allowed 
authenticated users with valid authorizations to control their IoT devices
and view historical collected data from their sensors.

This repository only has the main dashboard page and the login page, all
written in plain and pure JavaScript. The CSS style was inspired by
[this website](https://sandyuraz.com). Local version of plotly is included
to show pretty animated moving graphs of sensor data. (I know, 3.32MB...)

For more information on the project, visit the 
[root repository of the project](https://github.com/thecsw/sandissa-dev).
